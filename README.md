# The code

* _Pianeti_ is the Italian word for planets.
* Multi-planet fitting of radial velocity and transit data.
* It uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with a Bayesian approach.
* Ensemble sampler with affine invariance algorithm
([Godman & Weare, 2010](http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml)).
* _Python_ does the nice things: plots, call functions, printing, in/output files.
* _Fortran_ does the hard work: MCMC evolution, likelihood calculation, ensemble sampler evolution.
* Open-source code (GPL v 3.0).

**Free and fast code with the robustness of _Fortran_ and the versatility of _Python_**.

## Power of pyaneti

* Multiple independent Markov chains to sample the parameter space.
* Easy-to-use: it runs by providing only one input_fit.py file.
* Parallel computing with OpenMP.
* Automatic creation of posteriors, correlations, and ready-to-publish plots.
* Circular and eccentric orbits.
* Multi-planet fitting.
* Inclusion of RV and photometry jitter.
* Systemic velocities for multiple instruments.
* Stellar limb darkening [(Mandel & Agol, 2002)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/345520/meta#artAbst).
* Correct treatment of short and long cadence data ([Kipping, 2010](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/408/3/1758)).
* Single joint RV + transit fitting.
