## Paper II
### Written by Barrag치n O., et al.,

### Coming out soon!

The newest version works in simililar way to the version 1.0 of pyaneti. You should be able to compile it and run it following
this [tutorial](https://github.com/oscaribv/pyaneti/wiki). 
But, *this new version uses the lapack and blas libraries, be sure you have them, if no, the code may not compile*. You should be able to re-run all your scripts of the old pyaneti in this one (But not all the
input files for this new pyaneti will run in the old one!). 

#### New in this version:

* Now the code runs in _python 3_.
* Changes in plots.
* It runs transit fits for single transits.
* It runs multi-band fits.
* It runs GPs and multi-GPs regressions.

#### This version still preserves all the previous features

* Multiple independent Markov chains to sample the parameter space.
* Easy-to-use: it runs by providing only one input_fit.py file.
* Parallel computing with OpenMP.
* Automatic creation of posteriors, correlations, and ready-to-publish plots.
* Circular and eccentric orbits.
* Multi-planet fitting.
* Inclusion of RV and photometry jitter.
* Systemic velocities for multiple instruments.
* Stellar limb darkening [(Mandel & Agol, 2002)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/345520/meta#artAbst).
* Correct treatment of short and long cadence data ([Kipping, 2010](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/408/3/1758)).
* Single joint RV + transit fitting.
